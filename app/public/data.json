    "content": "A great advancement within communication came with the invention of moveable type, despite the Chinese using moveable type from the 11th century; its invention has no connection with that of Europe around 1440. At this time Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which used moveable metal type. This process was quicker than woodblock printing and as the metal type was more durable, the lettering more uniform, which led to fonts and typography. This process also greatly increased book production, allowing multiple books to be easily printed, and each page identical to the last the book then became more available and was not the sole province of the Church of Wealthy. This process even outdid the scribes which had to produce the text exactly as if, even if there were mistakes in the produced text they were copying. Despite this greater control and accuracy, the first issue of the first edition of the Kings James I bible, which was printed in London in 1611, had a quite unfortunate misprint of the seventh commandment, stating ‘Though shalt commit adultery.’ The mistake was only noticed about a year after the first print, after around a thousand copies had been sold. One of the few surviving copies of an original Gutenberg Bible can still be viewed at the British Library.",

Gothic was a name given by the Renaissance humanists in response to the angular and heavy style of writing. Despite the fact that printing from moveable type made professional copyists redundant, the earliest printed books left spaces for initials, marginal decorations and line finishings, in hope that their work would be seen as that of a scribes, who’s work was completed in such a manner by illuminators. One of the most renowned books to be printed using Blackletter is the Gutenberg Bible.",

In 1516 the Royal Mail first emerged and was founded by King Henry V1II. At this time, the King’s Posts were crucially dependent on horses for swift delivery timings. Charles I did not open the first public postal service until 1635, this process consisted of letters being carried between posts by mounted post-boys and were then delivered to the local postmaster. Despite being a slow process it remained largely unchanged for 150 years. By 1660 a postal service known as the Royal Mail was established, built on the distribution system for royal and government documents, due to the network of Post Offices the public could easily send and receive letters. It was not until 1852 that the first pillar-box was introduced and meant that people did not have to travel as far to send letters, but were not painted bright red until 1874.

This confusion continues today; as most of the major type foundries have created revivals of the font there are many different variations which exist, all with greatly different x-height, cap height and thickness. Due to the consistent and relatively large x-height, within Garamonds’ many designs, it is often used for type setting.

The simplest form of shaded type employs the use of a single white line offset to one side of the character but more usually the left hand side. This type is sometimes referred to as hand-tooled, a term which most likely originates from the process to tool the white lines on the type. There is another form of shaded type which most likely originates from the former styles from the early 19th century, which has become to be known as Inline; examples vary within the design but a common factor is a white line which runs down the centre of the thick stem of the characters, this line can even cut through the serif at the head and foot.",

The Western Union Telegraph Company didn’t want to be completely abandoned from the advancements of the communications market and employed Elisha Gray and Thomas Edison to develop their own telephone technology but the case was taken to the U.S Supreme Court, which upheld the patent rights of Bell. The company withstood many other legal altercations and later developed into American Telephone and Telegraph; forming the foundations of the modern telecommunications industry. “It is often cited that the industrial revolution brought about the true mobility of the masses, if this is so then it must also be recognised that the mobile telephone has revolutionised communication between the masses.

The font was first a collection of different faces created by various designers from different foundries causing the different versions to vary in point size and more. It was later that Gunter Gerhard Lange, who was the art director of H. Berthold AG. type foundry, revised the typeface increasing its flexibility and consistency within its design, whilst maintaining the fundamental features displayed amongst the original nineteenth-century designs.",

    "content": "Magnetic recording, which is used within audio and video tapes, was a concept first introduced by Valdemar Poulsen, a Danish inventor, around 1900. Poulsen designed this invention with office dictation and telephone recording in mind, but despite this technology being manufactured in America and Europe, it never gained popularity, yet German and English inventors persisted. The first working model used a cylinder drum which the wire was wrapped around. The recording head tracked the wire along the cylinder, which it made the recording on. The development of electronic amplifiers and oxide-coated recording tapes replaced old technologies therefore the sound quality was improved. Although BBC, CBC and other broadcasting agencies were still using the earlier methods of magnetic recording in the 1930s, this process was replaced by tape recordings by radio, film and music studios and almost universally adopted by the 1950s.",

    "content": "Advancements within communication have surely changed our lives for the better, and some I cannot think of living without; the radio’s invention was heavily reliant on the development of both the telegraph and the telephone, and was a further advancement of such technology. An Italian inventor, Guglielmo Marconi, managed to send and receive his first radio signal in 1895, by 1899 he had successfully sent a radio signal across the English Channel. Two years later, in 1902, Marconi successfully sent a signal from England to Newfoundland, the first transatlantic radiotelegraph message. Nikola Tesla is accredited with being the first person to patent the radio technology, which was overturned because of the patent which Marconi possessed, in 1943. This technological advancement has since become a staple in the household, when it was released for public use it meant that people did not have to wait a whole day for the printed news making communication even faster. “The fundamental rule of radio is that it relies upon radiowaves to transmit signals through the air. These signals can only travel relatively short distances between radio masts when compared to modern means of broadcasting and data communication, but the speed at which information travels between a transmitter and receiver in an instance is how radio became such a powerful communicative  device. Take for example earlier forms of media such as News Papers and Posters, there’s always one thing in common, they are tangible forms of media. Being a non-tangible form of media Radio became destined for commercial success with a potentially infinite audience and the ability to reach places previously too rural for the local paperboy. Never before had the news been able to travel twenty miles across open countryside to a remote location without someone or something acting as the courier. So radio was not only faster, but also cheaper than print. Its success was so prominent that in 1923 the British Broadcasting Company was formed as a service to the people of Great Britain and it was soon considered a right to have access to radio. In 1927 the BBC was granted a Royal Charter upon becoming the British Broadcasting Corporation where it pledged to ‘inform, educate and entertain’.” Interview with Calfyn ap Bryn–Broadcast Producer",

    "content": "Edward Johnston, renowned as a master calligrapher, created this font in 1918, which he drew for the London Underground and which still continues to be one of most effective and widely loved typographic identities. The design should also in-part be attributed to Eric Gill, for he was Johnston’s student and contributed to drawing up the designs, although Eric Gill was heavily influenced by his teacher, Johnston, whose influence is evident in the design of Gill Sans. The font was modelled on an ancient Roman antecedent which are the letters around the base of Trajan’s Column, which employed classical Roman proportions. The font is still in use on the Underground today, although it has been revived with an extra weight (light) added.",
