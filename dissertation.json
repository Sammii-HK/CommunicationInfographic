  "content": "A great advancement within communication came with the invention of moveable type, despite the Chinese using moveable type from the 11th century; its invention has no connection with that of Europe around 1440. At this time Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press, which used moveable metal type. This process was quicker than woodblock printing and as the metal type was more durable, the lettering more uniform, which led to fonts and typography. This process also greatly increased book production, allowing multiple books to be easily printed, and each page identical to the last the book then became more available and was not the sole province of the Church of Wealthy. This process even outdid the scribes which had to produce the text exactly as if, even if there were mistakes in the produced text they were copying. Despite this greater control and accuracy, the first issue of the first edition of the Kings James I bible, which was printed in London in 1611, had a quite unfortunate misprint of the seventh commandment, stating ‘Though shalt commit adultery.’ The mistake was only noticed about a year after the first print, after around a thousand copies had been sold. One of the few surviving copies of an original Gutenberg Bible can still be viewed at the British Library.",
